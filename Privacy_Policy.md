# Privacy Policy and Terms of Use
This privacy policy governs your use of the software application Free Game Findings ("Application") for mobile devices that was created by StOoPiD_U (Cedric). This is an app which allows you to receive phone notifications for updates, view an alternative list view of the latest posts, and save a post for later from the /r/FreeGameFindings subreddit.

# Data Usage
This application sends nothing to me for any reason. Locally saved data is secure and not accessible to the app owner or any third parties to my knowledge.

In the future there may be the inclusion of ads, which would likely send analytics to Google AdMob. That would be updated within this policy when that happens.

# Content of the Free game Findings Application
The content of the application is based on publicly available JSON data from the /r/FreeGameFindings subreddit. The application does not require you to have any account to use it, but the links provided from the JSON data may require such. The goal is to allow you to be redirected to the subreddit or the direct link from the subreddit post(s). 

The application saves content to a local database. Your saved items will build up said database. The notification and general JSON search does add to a database entry as well, but it only saves one string value to keep it extra small. If you choose to do so, you can be sent notifications for new posts. You will need to give the application permission to send notifications (on android versions 13 and above) and can then toggle on or off the ability to send a notification to your device.

# Changes
This privacy policy can end up being updated. If that is the case, the new policy will be listed in this document here or relocated elsewhere but wil be noted on the store page of this application. You are advised to consult this document for changes as continued use of the application is deemed approval of all of policy changes.
